Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of 
derived classes without knowing it.


A great example illustrating LSP (given by Uncle Bob in a podcast I heard recently) 
was how sometimes something that sounds right in natural language doesn't quite work 
in code.

In mathematics, a Square is a Rectangle. Indeed it is a specialization of a rectangle. 
The "is a" makes you want to model this with inheritance. However if in code you made 
Square derive from Rectangle, then a Square should be usable anywhere you expect a 
Rectangle. This makes for some strange behavior.

Imagine you had SetWidth and SetHeight methods on your Rectangle base class; this seems 
perfectly logical. However if your Rectangle reference pointed to a Square, then SetWidth 
and SetHeight doesn't make sense because setting one would change the other to match it. 
In this case Square fails the Liskov Substitution Test with Rectangle and the abstraction 
of having Square inherit from Rectangle is a bad one.

	  L  ->  LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE 	  
	  ----------------------------------------------
	  
	  	What is the motivation of Liskov principle?

		We usually create class hierarchies during the application development
		For example: we extend some classes creating some derived classes !!!
				
		It would be great if the new derived classed would work as well
		without replacing the functionality of the classes

		Otherwise the new classes can produce undesired effects when they are
		used in existing program modules.

	--------------------------------------------------

	- child classes should never break the parent class type definition
	
	- Let q(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects 
		y of type S where S is a subtype of T
			
	- subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
		( derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types )
		
		We have to make sure there will be no problems using the subtype or
		the original class Do not break functionality !!! we can call the methods anyway
	
	- we can solve it with the help of Template Pattern

	- it is not independent from Open Close Principle + interface segregation principle
		The violation of Liskov principle is a latent violation of Open Closed Principle !!!
